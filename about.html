							<h2>Nancy Paul</h2>
						</header>
						<img src="images/nancypaul.jpg" style="float:left; padding: 8px; height:150px; width:120px;"/><p>My name is Nancy Paul and I am fortunate to be a wife, mother, daughter, sister and friend and am surrounded by many truly wonderful people. My life has taken many twists and turns, all leading to who I am today. I am grateful for the opportunity to be in a career that makes use of my life experiences and my natural tendency towards compassion and encouragement. </p>
						<p>For the past 20+ years I have been a bookkeeper and I have also served business owners as a small business consultant and coach since 2009.  I have a BS degree as well as a Certificate in Management Foundations, both from the University of Maryland, University College.  I have earned the designation of Certified Professional Coach (CPC) and Associate Certified Coach (ACC) after having successfully completed my coach training at the International Coach Academy (ICA) and completing the requirements of the International Coach Federation (ICF).  I am also a Certified Quickbooks ProAdvisor and have held that designation since 2004.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Working with small business owners in various capacities always leaves me energized and fulfilled.  I enjoy helping others gain insight and new perspectives in all sorts of business and life issues.  My prior work also includes over 6 years as owner of a retail store specializing in self-help books and products and over 10 years as a country/swing dance competitor and instructor teaching individuals, couples and groups. I really enjoyed relating to and helping people accomplish this social skill and enjoyed watching them gain confidence as they improved through my lessons.</p>
						<br>
						<p>My entrepreneur skills, work ethic and drive to succeed are brought into all of my client work.  I want to touch as many lives as possible while remaining available for my children and family. I have learned in my own life the importance of understanding values, defining goals, maintaining integrity, self-confidence and being accountable. I have also learned that making decisions are easiest when you base them on your values and goals.</p>
